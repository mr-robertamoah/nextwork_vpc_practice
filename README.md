# 🚀 AWS VPC Practice Projects

A comprehensive collection of AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) projects for learning and certification preparation. This repository contains hands-on implementations ranging from basic VPC setup to advanced networking scenarios with security and monitoring.

**Inspired by:** [NextWork's AWS Networks Introduction](https://learn.nextwork.org/projects/aws-networks-intro)

## 📚 Project Overview

This repository follows a progressive learning approach, building from fundamental VPC concepts to advanced networking patterns and security implementations.

### 🏗️ **Project 01: Build a Virtual Private Cloud**
**Fundamentals | AWS Console**
- Basic VPC creation and configuration
- Understanding CIDR blocks and IP addressing
- Setting up DNS resolution and hostnames
- Foundation for all subsequent networking projects

### 🔄 **Project 02: VPC Traffic Flow and Security**
**Traffic Analysis | Console + Basic Security**
- Analyzing traffic flow patterns within VPC
- Understanding ingress and egress rules
- Basic security group configurations
- Network traffic inspection fundamentals

### 🔒 **Project 03: Creating a Private Subnet**
**Network Segmentation | Console**
- Implementing private subnet architectures
- Understanding public vs private subnet differences
- Route table configuration for internal resources
- Network isolation patterns

### 🚀 **Project 04: Launching VPC Resources**
**Complete Infrastructure | Terraform + Console**
- **Full VPC with public and private subnets**
- EC2 instances in both subnet types
- Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway setup
- Security Groups and Network ACLs
- **Key Learning:** End-to-end VPC resource deployment

```
Architecture: VPC → IGW → Public Subnet (EC2) → Private Subnet (EC2)
Implementation: Terraform modules with comprehensive testing
```

### 🌐 **Project 06: VPC Peering**
**Inter-VPC Connectivity | Terraform**
- **Cross-VPC communication setup**
- VPC peering connection configuration
- Route table updates for peered VPCs
- Security considerations for peered networks
- **Key Learning:** Connecting multiple VPCs for resource sharing

```
Architecture: VPC-A ↔ Peering Connection ↔ VPC-B
Use Case: Multi-environment connectivity (dev ↔ staging)
```

### 📊 **Project 07: VPC Monitoring with Flow Logs**
**Network Monitoring | Terraform + CloudWatch**
- **VPC Flow Logs implementation**
- CloudWatch integration for log analysis
- Traffic pattern monitoring and analysis
- Network troubleshooting with flow data
- **Key Learning:** Visibility into network traffic and security monitoring

```
Flow: VPC → Flow Logs → CloudWatch → Analysis & Alerts
Monitoring: Traffic patterns, security events, performance metrics
```

### 🗄️ **Project 08: Access S3 from a VPC**
**Cloud Storage Integration | Terraform**
- **S3 bucket creation and management**
- VPC-to-S3 connectivity patterns
- IAM roles and policies for EC2-S3 access
- Bucket policies and access control
- **Key Learning:** Integrating storage services with VPC resources

```
Architecture: VPC → EC2 (IAM Role) → S3 Bucket
Security: IAM policies + Bucket policies for controlled access
```

### 🛡️ **Project 09: VPC Endpoints**
**Private AWS Service Access | Terraform**
- **S3 Gateway VPC Endpoints implementation**
- Restrictive bucket policies for VPC-only access
- Private routing to AWS services without internet
- Comprehensive testing and validation scripts
- **Key Learning:** Secure, cost-effective access to AWS services

```
Architecture: VPC → Gateway Endpoint → S3 (Private Access)
Security: Bucket policies restricting access to VPC endpoint only
Cost Optimization: No NAT Gateway charges for S3 access
```

## 🛠️ Implementation Approach

### **Dual Implementation Strategy**
Each project follows a comprehensive learning approach:

1. **🖥️ AWS Console First**
   - Visual understanding of service relationships
   - Manual configuration to grasp concepts
   - AWS UI familiarity for troubleshooting

2. **⚙️ Terraform Implementation**
   - Infrastructure as Code for repeatability
   - Version control and change management
   - Production-ready automation practices

### **Progressive Complexity**
- **Projects 01-03:** Foundation concepts via AWS Console
- **Projects 04-06:** Infrastructure automation with basic Terraform
- **Projects 07-09:** Advanced patterns with modular Terraform architecture

## 📋 Key Technologies & Concepts

### **AWS Services Covered**
- **VPC:** Virtual Private Clouds, Subnets, Route Tables
- **Networking:** Internet Gateways, NAT Gateways, VPC Endpoints
- **Security:** Security Groups, NACLs, IAM Roles & Policies
- **Compute:** EC2 instances across public/private subnets
- **Storage:** S3 integration with VPC resources
- **Monitoring:** VPC Flow Logs, CloudWatch integration
- **Connectivity:** VPC Peering for inter-VPC communication

### **Infrastructure as Code**
- **Terraform:** Resource provisioning and management
- **Modular Design:** Reusable components across projects
- **State Management:** Remote state and team collaboration patterns
- **Best Practices:** Resource tagging, variable management, outputs

### **Security Patterns**
- **Network Segmentation:** Public/private subnet architectures
- **Access Control:** Multi-layered security with SGs and NACLs
- **IAM Integration:** Least privilege access for resources
- **Private Connectivity:** VPC endpoints for AWS service access
