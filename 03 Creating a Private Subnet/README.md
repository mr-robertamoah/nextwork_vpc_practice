# VPC Traffic Flow and Security Documentation

This directory contains Terraform configuration files to manage and secure traffic flow within an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). The resources defined here build upon the base VPC infrastructure and focus on routing, security, and access control.

## Files
- `main.tf`: Main configuration for traffic flow and security resources, such as route tables, security groups, and network ACLs.
- `provider.tf`: AWS provider configuration (if present).
- `variables.tf`: Input variables for customizing traffic flow and security settings.
- `outputs.tf`: Output values for key resources created in this configuration.

## Resources Created
- **Route Tables**: Define how traffic is routed within the VPC and to external networks. Custom routes can be added for internet access, NAT gateways, or peering connections.
- **Security Groups**: Virtual firewalls for controlling inbound and outbound traffic to AWS resources (e.g., EC2 instances). Rules can be customized for specific ports, protocols, and sources.
- **Network ACLs (Access Control Lists)**: Additional layer of security at the subnet level, allowing or denying traffic based on rules.
- **Other Networking Components**: May include NAT gateways, VPN connections, or VPC endpoints, depending on configuration.

## Customization
- Variables allow you to specify CIDR blocks, allowed IP ranges, port access, and other security settings.
- You can define custom rules for security groups and network ACLs to meet your application's requirements.

## Usage
1. Initialize Terraform: `terraform init`
2. Review the plan: `terraform plan`
3. Apply the configuration: `terraform apply`

## Outputs
After deployment, key information such as security group IDs, route table IDs, and network ACL IDs will be displayed, as defined in `outputs.tf`.
